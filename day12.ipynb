    "You're about to settle near a complex arrangement of garden plots when some Elves ask if you can lend a hand. They'd like to set up fences around each region of garden plots, but they can't figure out how much fence they need to order or how much it will cost. They hand you a map (your puzzle input) of the garden plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each garden plot grows only a single type of plant and is indicated by a single letter on your map. When multiple garden plots are growing the same type of plant and are touching (horizontally or vertically), they form a region. For example:\n",

The type A and C plants are each in a region with perimeter 10. The type B and E plants are each in a region with perimeter 8. The lone D plot forms its own region with perimeter 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually indicating the sides of plots in each region that contribute to the perimeter using - and |, the above map's regions' perimeters are measured as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Due to \"modern\" business practices, the price of fence required for a region is found by multiplying that region's area by its perimeter. The total price of fencing all regions on a map is found by adding together the price of fence for every region on the map.\n",

    "In the first example, region `A` has price `4 * 10 = 40`, region `B` has price `4 * 8 = 32`, region `C` has price `4 * 10 = 40`, region `D` has price `1 * 4 = 4`, and region `E` has price `3 * 8 = 24`. So, the total price for the first example is `140`.\n",
